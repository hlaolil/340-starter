# - The Enhencement Project
This enhancement extends the existing account management system by adding an
account list view with a dynamic last name search and real-time account count,
improving how users query and interact with account data. It interacts directly with the
database through the account modelâ€™s query methods to retrieve account records. The
account controller is updated with new functions to support queries and pass data to the
view. The account list view is enhanced to include the search input, dynamic table
display, and live account count. The model uses prepared SQL statements and error
handling in the controller to ensure robustness and data integrity. Access control is used
to check that only admin roles can view accounts.
